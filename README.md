# GesturePic - Navigate Photos with Hand Gestures using Computer Vision 🖐🏻

GesturePic allows users to navigate between photos using hand gestures detected with computer vision techniques.

## Overview
This project implements hand gesture recognition using the mediapipe and OpenCV libraries to track finger and palm positions in real-time from a webcam video stream.
You can swipe left and right through a folder of images by moving your hand 👋🏻

The goal was to explore building intuitive human-computer interaction through contactless gestures without needing additional hardware input devices.

## Usage
- **Create a "photos" folder containing images in the same path of notebook**
- **Run the notebook**
- **Place your hand in view of the camera**
- **Swipe left/right or use (index and middle) finger motions to navigate photos**

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- mediapipe
- Jupyter notebook
- Tensorflow
- Numpy

## Key Features
- Real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition
- Ability to view multiple images in a folder seamlessly
- Easy to use
